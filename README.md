# The-Great-Cavern
A short text-adventure coded in Python. More of an engine, than a game at the moment.
To do List:
Add more NPC Interaction
Generalize Events
Add Graphics

Later on a C# port of this was written followed by an extensive rewrite that added graphics, and a very flexible engine, though there isn't a way to interact with NPCs yet.
